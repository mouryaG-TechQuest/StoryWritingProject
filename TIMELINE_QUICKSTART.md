## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### "No scenes in this story yet"
**Cause**: Story doesn't have timeline data  
**Solution**: Story was created without scenes - switch to "Full Story" view

### "Edit Scene button not showing"
**Cause**: You're not the story owner  
**Solution**: Only story authors can edit - create your own story to edit

### "Timeline bar not scrolling"
**Cause**: Browser zoom or CSS issue  
**Solution**: Reset browser zoom to 100% (Ctrl+0)

### "Characters not highlighted"
**Cause**: Description doesn't use proper format  
**Solution**: Use `***Name***` format (three asterisks on each side)
